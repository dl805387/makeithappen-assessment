# makeithappen-assessment

instructions\
npm install\
npm start\
make sure to npm start on the parent folder(makeithappen-assessment)\
npm run dev also works

edit: there seems to be a bug where the number generator uses the same number 3 times in safari\
this does not seem to be an issue with chrome
